# AI-Public-Transport
This AI gathers information from your city, and gives you the possible outcome on how should the city be connected.

# Main Goal: 

The main objective of my project was first to create a IA system that could develop a metro/public transportation system for cities that do not have the infrastructure. Artificial Intelligence (AI) would do this based on aerial footage of the cities, recognizing zones where people live, work,etc. We know there's algorithms that are able to connect x amount of points in a plane in the most efficient way, but since we don't have those points, this is not applicable. After a full semester of looking for the most efficient way for me to develop this project, the goal changed to the following: the AI should be able to detect whether a city has low or high population density. 


The AI has a dataset of ten low density satellite images, and ten high density satellite images of cities all around the world, I used cities all over the globe for the AI to have enough and different training variations, since cities from same countries, continents or situations could be developing their cities in the same way.

This was my goal because a lot of third world countries, including Mexico, may or may not have the economic resources to create an actual plan to build public transportation around their main cities, I believe this project could help a lot of cities like the one I live in, and to many others that live in similar conditions than me, also, the more we train this model, this AI could also help cities that are not that similar to mine.

# Future Additions

This project is lacking in a lot of ways, but the main addition from point of view should be the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to actually connect this stations in the most efficient way, one other implementation should be the reshape of the image when being seen at the final canvas, also, a lot of high density city in the dataset, have a lot of areas with the same density, which does not allow my AI to create and connect in the most efficient way. Also giving more images to both datasets would be the best thing to do.

I saw a lot of projects that I would wanted to implement into my code but I was not able to, another addition could be training data could be done with this same satellite images but now adding cities with actually metro/systems that are efficient, that way we could combine Dijkstra's algorithm with real life situations, also the AI doesn't know a lot of data like the shape of the surface, terrain type, places were we find actual roads, old train tracks, etc. All of this could make this project an actual real life tool that could be sold to governments to implement solutions to their cities.
